puppet manifest creator
=======================
This is a generic script that creates a complete puppet manifest based on input from the user. Add files, services, packages and users (adding more soon) to the config files as well as control configuration files with file_line (may need to install stdlib). This script will generate all the required puppet code to either apply locally back to your node or move it to a puppet master using the server_name role created when the script runs. It enables quick configuration management of your legacy servers as well as providing a way to manage the code once it's been generated. Generates manifests for all your legacy servers so you can bring them under puppet management.

Use case
--------
 1. Quickly creating a manifest of your exisiting servers.
 2. Locally apply the manifest back from the apply.pp script generated by the script.
 3. Move the manifest (under the server name) into a puppet master. Set the role and manage with your master.
 4. Create/rebuild legacy servers based on the manifest you create.

Changelog
---------
 * [ Added hostname factorisation. All .erb files are checked for the hostname of the server and replaced by local fact @hostname ]
 * [ Created a role that can be run on a puppet master based on the files managed by the script ]
 * [ Added the ability to create a "file_line" managed config file in addition to a template ]
 * [ catered for hostnames with - and changed them to _ ]
 * [ Added fstab (mount) as a defualt option. It doesn't need to be added to any configs ]
 * [ Added option to manage users. Add list of users to the config file to generate a manifets for them ]

Dependencies
------------
 * Puppet version 3.0 or above.
 * Git.
 * Install puppetlabs-stdlib to the /opt/HOST_ directory (may be required).

Usage
-----
 1. Clone the Repo - git clone https://github.com/dmccuk/puppet_legacy_manifest.git
 2. cd into the cloned directory. Examples in each of the files described below:
      * Update "files_managed_by_templates.dm" with the name and location of what you want to manage.
      * Update "services_packages.dm" with the serivce name and the package name.
      * update "files_managed_by_file_line.dm" with the files you wish to create a "file_line" output for.
 3. To run:
      * ./manifest_creator.sh 
 4. The script will run and create the following directory tree:
      * /opt/$hostname
      * The manifests will be created under this DIR.
      * an "apply.pp" script will be created that you can run to apply the maifest back to the server. See apply.pp for more information once run.
      * A role_$hostname will alos be created so you can move the code to a puppet master and manage via the role.

Development
===========
Plans are to add the following:

  * Data abstraction of IP addresses where appropiate.
   * Add metadata.json file to all manifests.

Issues:
------
[1]
If you see this when running puppet apply:

    Error: Evaluation Error: Error while evaluating a Resource Statement, Invalid resource type file_line at /opt/server_name/sshd_config/manifests/init.pp:3:3 on node server1

You need to download and install puppetlabs-stdlib to your working directory. In this case it's /opt/$HOST_. The file_line type requires stdlib is installed.

    # puppet module install -i . -f  puppetlabs-stdlib
    Notice: Preparing to install into /opt/fedora_22 ...
    Notice: Downloading from https://forgeapi.puppetlabs.com ...
    Notice: Installing -- do not interrupt ...

Now run puppet apply or the apply.pp script again.
